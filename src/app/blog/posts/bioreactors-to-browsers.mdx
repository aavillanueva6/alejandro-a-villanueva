Hey there! I wanted to share my experience transitioning from chemical engineering to software development – a career pivot that's been challenging, rewarding, and full of surprises along the way.

## Why Software? Why Now?

I've always considered myself a lifetime learner. After relocating to the Seattle area, I couldn't help but notice the vibrant tech scene around me. Friends were solving fascinating problems through code, creating solutions with tangible, real-world impact – something that's always motivated me throughout my career.

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed my years in Biotech at Lilly and AGC Bio. I had the opportunity to both lead and participate in some really great projects, from my first project where I installed a set of pumps that ended up getting named after me (light hazing from the operations team), to being on the team to design the manufacturing facility for a new product at Lilly, to designing and building facilities for mAb, microbial, and cell & gene lines at AGC. But I found myself seeking a new chapter and fresh avenues for growth. Seattle's tech ecosystem presented the perfect opportunity to explore that path.

## Engineering Mindset: A Secret Weapon

When I enrolled in the University of Washington's Full Stack Web Development certification program, I quickly discovered that my engineering background gave me a unique advantage. The methodical problem-solving approach ingrained through my formal education and years in process engineering translated remarkably well to coding challenges.

I often hear my first engineering mentor's voice in the back of my head while tackling a difficult problem: break it down to basics, refer to fundamental concepts and documentation, then build your solution from there. This approach helped me grasp web development concepts rapidly and apply them to design my own solutions.

## Managing Projects: Different Fields, Similar Principles

My experience managing complex projects in pharmaceutical manufacturing has proved invaluable when organizing software development work. Throughout my career, I've learned to identify critical aspects of a project and manage workloads appropriately.

While pharma and software seem worlds apart at first glance, I've noticed interesting parallels. In managing pharmaceutical and construction projects, you coordinate different trades and technical areas. This aligns surprisingly well with managing the various components of a web development project – backend, frontend, UI/UX, branding, architecture – and integrating them into a cohesive final product.

When working with software project teams, I've often found myself naturally slipping into project management roles. Breaking down work into achievable tasks, dividing responsibilities, and sometimes even assuming the role of scrum master to run standup meetings – these skills transferred directly from my previous career.

## Process Optimization → Code Optimization

Another similarity I've noticed between my engineering past and coding present involves the concept of incremental improvement. During much of my chemical engineering career, I worked with well-established processes, making targeted improvements to increase uptime, throughput, or process safety.

I see the same patterns in software development. After creating a working project, I find myself naturally looking for optimizations – making an algorithm more efficient, breaking large code blocks into smaller, reusable components, or refactoring for better readability. Both fields value the discipline of taking systematic steps toward improving an already functioning system.

## Unexpected Transferable Skills

My experience with technical documentation in engineering has proven surprisingly helpful in my coding journey. Years of writing and interpreting complex technical documents developed my ability to read coding documentation effectively and quickly identify the core principles being presented.

## The Challenges

The most challenging aspect of this transition has been keeping pace with constantly evolving technology. Even while learning a framework or language, new versions are released that can change how things are implemented. The only effective response is to embrace this reality. This industry demands continuous learning and growth – which is stimulating but can also be demanding.

Another adjustment has been working primarily as a solo developer. In my engineering career, I was used to having teams to consult and bounce ideas off. Working through problems independently has pushed me to learn concepts more deeply and quickly than I might have otherwise. I look forward to beginning my software career professionally, to contribute to and learn from a strong team.

## What I Love About Software Development

One of the most satisfying aspects of software engineering compared to chemical engineering is the visibility of my work. In my previous roles, I mostly worked on projects that were removed from public view. While they had important impacts, there's something uniquely rewarding about creating software that's online and accessible to everyone.

## Advice for Engineers Considering the Switch

If you're an engineer contemplating a similar transition, I'll be honest – this field is challenging, and the job market is competitive. However, with tenacity and persistent effort, success is absolutely achievable.

The key is embracing continuous learning. In my relatively short time in software development, I've already witnessed major changes to systems and technologies – React releasing versions 18 and 19 within 2.5 years (the time that I have spent learning it), Next.js updating almost yearly. Staying current requires a commitment to growth.

But that's also what makes this space exciting. The foundational problem-solving skills you've developed as an engineer are more valuable than you might realize. They provide a sturdy framework upon which to build your technical skills.

The engineering mindset – methodical, analytical, focused on fundamentals – is a powerful advantage in the world of software. Trust that background, combine it with curiosity and persistence, and you might find, as I have, that you're not starting from scratch after all.

I'm still early in this journey myself, but I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. If you're considering a similar path, I hope hearing about my experience helps you take that first step.
