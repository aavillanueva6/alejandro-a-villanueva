## Overview

Native mobile application developed with React Native and TypeScript, delivering WETF Radio's jazz programming directly to listeners' mobile devices. The app provides a streamlined, native experience focusing on core functionality: live streaming, program schedules, and station information. Built with a mobile-first mindset, the application emphasizes performance and user experience while maintaining consistency across iOS and Android platforms.

## Key Features

- **Native Audio Streaming**: Custom-built mobile audio player providing high-quality streaming with native device controls integration and background playback support.
- **Cross-Platform Design**: Unified user experience across iOS and Android while respecting platform-specific design patterns and interaction models.
- **Responsive Show Schedule**: Dynamic display of weekly radio programming with show times, titles, and host names.
- **Light / Dark Mode Toggle**: Button to allow user to switch between light and dark mode.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native with TypeScript**: Cross-platform mobile framework enabling native performance while maintaining type safety and code maintainability.

## Challenges and Learnings

The transition from web to mobile development presented unique challenges, particularly in handling audio playback across different mobile operating systems. Each platform has its own set of requirements and limitations for background audio, requiring careful consideration of battery life and system resources.

Working without a UI framework pushed me to deeply understand React Native's styling system and platform-specific design patterns. This hands-on experience with custom styling improved my grasp of mobile UI/UX principles and the importance of platform-specific considerations in cross-platform development.

## Outcome

The mobile application successfully extends WETF Radio's digital presence to native mobile platforms, providing listeners with a dedicated, high-performance solution for accessing station content. The app demonstrates the ability to translate web application concepts to mobile while respecting platform-specific best practices and user expectations.

The mobile application is in development. It will go live to app stores after final client approval.
