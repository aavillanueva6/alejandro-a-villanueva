## Overview

Modern web application built with React and TypeScript for a type-safe frontend, styled with Bootstrap for responsive design. Backend implemented using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the document database. Complete JavaScript/TypeScript stack enabling efficient development and maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Live Radio Streaming**: Configured custom audio streaming controls to allow users to listen to the station live from anywhere.
- **PWA**: Application is PWA capable, allowing users to download the application to their local devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **TypeScript**: For a type-safe codebase. Ensuring that errors and bugs will be minimized, improving code maintainability.
- **MongoDB and Apollo GraphQL**: For fast development with flexible documents, a single endpoint with precise control over fetched data, and client side caching for fast response to user interactions.
- **Bootstrap**: For configuring a responsive and user friendly UI, that matches the client's branding.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was identifying the client's desires for the project and building the site to meet their requirements. Learned the importance of building flexible data structures to the database - we identified a many-to-many relationship late in the development after building the data structure as a many-to-one relationship. This required a significant rework of portions of the project where the data was not assumed to be in an array format.

This project was also my first project utilizing TypeScript. I learned how to implement TypeScript, and the benefits of using it for error reducing while writing code for a project.

## Outcome

The website is undergoing final review before launching to production. Upon client approval, the site will go live at their designated URL.
