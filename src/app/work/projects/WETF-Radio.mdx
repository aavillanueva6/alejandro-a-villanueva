## Overview

Modern web application built with React and TypeScript for a type-safe frontend, styled with Bootstrap for responsive design. Backend implemented using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB an Apollo GraphQL for efficient data management. Complete JavaScript/TypeScript stack enabling efficient development and maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Live Radio Streaming**: Immersive web-based radio player with custom controls, delivering high-quality audio streaming to listeners worldwide in real-time.
- **PWA**: Seamlessly transforms into a native-like application experience, enabling offline access and instant launches from users' home screens across all devices.
- **Responsive Show Schedule**: Dynamic display of weekly radio programming with show times, descriptions, and links to additional show details.
- **Staff Profiles**: Dedicated sections showcasing station personalities with bios and show information.

## Technologies Used

- **React and TypeScript**: Frontend architecture leveraging type-safe components for robust, maintainable code that scales.
- **MongoDB and Apollo GraphQL**: Optimized data layer combining flexible document storage with precise GraphQL queries, enhanced by intelligent client-side caching for lightning-fast user interactions.
- **Bootstrap**: Production-ready UI framework enabling responsive layouts and consistent brand styling across all device sizes.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout development, a key challenge was translating client requirements into technical specifications while maintaining flexibility for future changes. This became particularly evident when we discovered a many-to-many relationship that had initially been architected as many-to-one. The subsequent database restructuring highlighted the critical importance of thorough data modeling during the planning phase.

The project also served as my introduction to TypeScript. Implementing strong typing not only reduced runtime errors but also improved code maintainability through enhanced IDE support and automated refactoring capabilities.

## Outcome

The website is undergoing final review before launching to production. Upon client approval, the site will go live at their designated URL.
